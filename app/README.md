This folder stores the text documents required to index. Here you can find a sample of 1000 documents from `a.parquet` file from the original source.

### mapreduce
This folder stores the mapper `mapperx.py` and reducer `reducerx.py` scripts for the MapReduce pipelines.

### app.py
This is a Python file to write code to store index data in Cassandra.

### app.sh
The entrypoint for the executables in your repository and includes all commands that will run your programs in this folder.

### create_index.sh
A script to create index data using MapReduce pipelines and store them in HDFS.

### index.sh
A script to run the MapReduce pipelines and the programs to store data in Cassandra/ScyllaDB.

### add_to_index.sh
Bonus script for adding one local `<doc_id>_<doc_title>.txt` file to the existing Cassandra/ScyllaDB index without rebuilding the full MapReduce index.

### add_to_index.py
Python helper used by `add_to_index.sh` to parse the document, update document metadata, vocabulary, postings, and corpus statistics in Cassandra/ScyllaDB, and emit the corresponding prepared HDFS input record.

### prepare_data.py

### requirements.txt
This file contains all Python depenedencies that are needed for running the programs in this repository. This file is read by pip when installing the dependencies in `app.sh` script.

### search.sh
This script will be responsible for running the `query.py` PySpark app on Hadoop YARN cluster.


### start-services.sh
This script will initiate the services required to run Hadoop components. This script is called in `app.sh` file.
